1. **`src/`**: This is the source directory for your Astro project.
2. **`components/`**: This directory contains all the React.js components used in your Astro project.
3. **`feature/`**: This directory contains the feature-specific components, which are further organized into `data/`, `service/`, and `view/` sub-directories.
   - **`data/`**: This directory contains the data-related files, such as data sources and repositories.
   - **`service/`**: This directory contains the service-related files, such as structures and use cases.
   - **`view/`**: This directory contains the view-related files, such as pages, common components, and state management.
4. **`shared/`**: This directory contains any shared or reusable components that are not specific to a particular feature.
5. **`pages/`**: This directory contains the Astro pages that will be used to build your website.

## Feature Implementation: Blog

Let's explore the implementation of the blog feature within the Astro build framework with React.js integration.

### `blog-data-source.ts`

This file contains the implementation of the `BlogDataSource` class, which is responsible for fetching blog post data from a data source (in this case, a mock data source).

### `blog-repository.ts`

This file contains the implementation of the `BlogRepository` class, which acts as an abstraction layer between the data source and the service layer.

### `blog-structure.ts`

This file defines the structure and types for the blog-related data, such as the `BlogPost` interface.

### `blog-use-case.ts`

This file contains the implementation of the `BlogUseCase` class, which encapsulates the business logic for retrieving blog posts.

### `blog-page.tsx`

This is the main page component for the blog feature, which manages the state of the blog page, fetches the latest blog posts using the `BlogUseCase`, and renders the appropriate UI based on the current state (loading, error, or success).

### `blog-list.tsx`

This component represents a list of blog posts, rendering the `BlogDetail` component for each post.

### `blog-detail.tsx`

This component represents the detailed view of a single blog post, displaying the post's title, author, content, and creation date.

### Diagram that explains the relationship between the BlogRepository, BlogDataSource, and the service layer (represented by the BlogUseCase class):

```

### 1. BlogUseCase:

This class represents the service layer, which encapsulates the business logic for retrieving and manipulating blog posts. The BlogUseCase class interacts with the BlogRepository to fetch the necessary data.

### 2. BlogRepository:

This class acts as an abstraction layer between the service layer (represented by the BlogUseCase) and the data source (represented by the BlogDataSource). The BlogRepository provides a consistent interface for the service layer to interact with the blog post data, regardless of the underlying data source.

### 3. BlogDataSource:

This class is responsible for fetching the actual blog post data, whether it's from an API, a database, or a mock data source. The BlogRepository uses the BlogDataSource to retrieve the necessary data.
